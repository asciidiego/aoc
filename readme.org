* Advent of Code

My implementations of the Advent of Code puzzles.

My answers are calculated using Github Actions. Microsoft robots kneel before my
code and execute their orders. After the robots finish their duties, like good
robots they are, they are ordered to write a report in a human-friendly way.
After all, it is US who want to understand what the hell happened in the field.
Because of that, their orders is to pick an =org= formatted document, and fill
the blanks with each battle outcome. Namely, the answer they get for each Advent
of Code exercise.

Finally, the outcome of the computing battle is rendered below in Markdown
format. The lingua franca of the Github Kingdom. But, since I do not want to
/spoil/ the fun for anyone reading this, the answers are hidden behind a strong
layer of HTML+Markdown magic kindly executed by the generous Microsoft robot
army.
